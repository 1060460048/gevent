 What is gevent?
=================

gevent is a coroutine_ -based Python_ networking library that uses
greenlet_ to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the `libev`_
or `libuv`_ event loop.

Features include:

* Fast event loop based on `libev`_ or `libuv`_
* Lightweight execution units based on greenlet_.
* API that re-uses concepts from the Python standard library (for
  examples there are :class:`events <gevent.event.Event>` and
  :class:`queues <gevent.queue.Queue>`).
* :ref:`Cooperative sockets with SSL support <networking>`
* :doc:`Cooperative DNS queries <dns>` performed through a threadpool, dnspython, or c-ares.
* :ref:`Monkey patching utility <monkey-patching>` to get 3rd party modules to become cooperative
* TCP/UDP/HTTP servers
* Subprocess support (through :mod:`gevent.subprocess`)
* Thread pools


gevent is `inspired by eventlet
<http://blog.gevent.org/2010/02/27/why-gevent/>`_ but features more
consistent API, simpler implementation and better performance. Read
