It is now possible to build and use the embedded libuv on a Cygwin
platform.

Note that Cygwin is not an officially supported platform of upstream
libuv and is not tested by gevent, so the actual working status is
unknown, and this may bitrot in future releases.

Thanks to berkakinci for the patch.
