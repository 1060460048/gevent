gevent can now be built using Cython 3.0a2 and newer.

The libev extension was incompatible with this. As part of this,
certain internal, undocumented names have been changed.

However, up through at least 3.0a4 compiling with Cython 3 results in
gevent's test for memory leaks failing. See `this Cython issue
<https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3578>`_.
