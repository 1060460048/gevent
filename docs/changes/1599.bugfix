gevent can now be built using Cython 3.0a5 and newer. The PyPI
distribution uses this version.

The libev extension was incompatible with this. As part of this,
certain internal, undocumented names have been changed.

(Technically, gevent can be built with Cython 3.0a2 and above.
However, up through 3.0a4 compiling with Cython 3 results in
gevent's test for memory leaks failing. See `this Cython issue
<https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3578>`_.)
