On CPython, depend on greenlet >= 0.4.17. This version is binary
incompatible with earlier releases on CPython 3.7 and later.

On Python 3.7 and above, the module ``gevent.contextvars`` is no
longer monkey-patched into the standard library. contextvars are now
both greenlet and asyncio task local. See :issue:`1656`.
